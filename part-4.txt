-- Started by downloading the Daily Coronavirus dataset from https://data.world/markmarkoh/coronavirus-data & then reviewed the data. As I review, need to start making a list of tables (representing each object/entity, not ideas/concepts) for my database. Then make a column list for each table, including datatype for each column. Try to include all data from the dataset in my data model. Lastly, notate relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Then create a draft on DB Designer and create a final version, export PDF when finished.



UNFORTUNATELY, already spent a solid 2 days on part 2/3 with a far more complex dataset. Need to move on, do not have the time to do that again. This data set is organized far better to begin with and does not have ~200 abbreviated column names requiring explanation, it is very straight-forward and already in 1NF (date column is UNIQUE, so that could be used as Primary Key). I believe it fulfills the requirements for 2NF and 3NF as well. Tables could be split up for each country to reduce the # of empty/null values, but I think it better to keep the tables as is. Empty/null values are representative of a lack of reporting.
